#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
a = handle.read()
b = a.split("\n")
c = {}
for i in b:
    if i.startswith("From "):
        d = i.split()
        if d[1] not in c:
            c[d[1]] = 1
        else:
            c[d[1]] = 1 + c[d[1]]
#print c
prolific_email = None
email_count = 0
for e,f in c.items():
    if f > email_count:
        prolific_email = e
        email_count = f
print prolific_email, email_count
